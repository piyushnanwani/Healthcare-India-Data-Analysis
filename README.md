# Healthcare-India-Data-Analysis

Big data analytics is the process of examining large and varied data sets i.e.,
big data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends,
customer preferences and other useful information that can help organizations
make more-informed business decisions.

Healthcare System in India has a lot of problems. I decided to investigate these
problems with help of Data Science. I downloaded datasets in CSV format.
Cleaned the datasets and tried to find out meaningful patterns and derived
results from these data sets. I found out details about present scenario of
health centres of all states in India, their shortage , their current numbers .
