# Healthcare-India-Data-Analysis

Every year, 55 million Indians are propelled into poverty because of out-of-
pocket expenditure on health care, primarily medicine costs. The country
currently spend just 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product on health care â€”
one of the lowest expenditures in the world. Last year, however, the country
released its new National Health Policy, the first in 14 years, and pledged to
boost health care spending up to 2.5 percent by 2025.
While care in government-run hospitals is technically free for everyone, the
system is marred by long queues, poor quality of care, and a lack of human
resources.
